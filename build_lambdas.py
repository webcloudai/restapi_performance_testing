# helper script to build and prepare deployment for AWS Lambda when pip is used as a package manager
# NOTE: it's expected that:
# - every lambda function is located in the dedicated subfolder of src folder named exactly as Lambda function
# - requirements for all lambdas are available in lambda_requirements.txt file
#   (this may be improved with different requirements per lambda)
#
# This script is somewhat analog of this set of commands executed for every lambda
